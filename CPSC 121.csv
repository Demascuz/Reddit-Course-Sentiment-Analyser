2,"Iâ€™m a SD student from last term and well, looks like Iâ€™ll be seeing yâ€™all in the summer",5
3,Does anyone who took it before know if there would be scale?,3
4,crying n throwing up,1
5,Mfw I had a UBCsecure moment and I lost all my progress on one of the longest proof questions which made me lose like 15min :(,2
6,How leniently do they grade? Cause if they are too strict i will fail ðŸ˜­. Like do we get partial marks and stuff?,2
7,Felt like a fair exam.,4
8,DOES ANYONE REMEMBER HOW MANY POINTS THE EXAM WAS OUT OF IM TRYNA REMEMBER THE POINTS OF EACH QUESTION TO SEE IF I PASSED,3
9,"Am I missing something? Aside from that one induction and mod question, I couldnâ€™t have hoped for a more fair examâ€¦",3
10,"It was easy except I didn't know the notation for the binary induction, so I hope they like what I came up with.",3
11,The time limit was pretty damn constraining,3
12,Seems like this is the most complained about class by far,5
13,I wish someone was sucking the soul outta me ðŸ˜©,1
14,It gets better. Most other courses are much more interesting than 121.,3
15,Hang in there bud.,5
16,I hated 121 and didnâ€™t do that well in it relative to other CS classes. Every 2nd and 3rd year cs class Iâ€™ve done since has been far less painful,2
17,I wish there were other career paths that paid decent salaries because cs is absolute cancer.,2
18,"Congrats i hate it too, completely useless imo",1

22,i felt like the person next to me has running nose,2
23,alternative title: insane rant of a pre comp sci student,1
24,First and second year CPSC is generally pretty insane. It gets better in third year when they aren't trying to weed students out.,3
25,op has time to write this much but no time to learn the course material properly kekw,3
26,The only insanity here is this post,1
27,"Thanks to the insane midterm grading I was able to get 100% on the first midterm last year:3

However the final was not as kind to me",3
28,Lol rekt kid. You will get used to it. Prepares you for the work force.,5
29,I agree. Email the admin maybe about it?,3
30,Why not address these questions with the the person(s) who did the grading? This rant is practically incoherent.,1
31,that circuit LMFAO ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,5
32,Did anyone else not finish the logical equivalence proof or is it just me lol,1
33,It was honestly brutal. A lot harder than the past midterms in my opinion,3
34,I got rocked,5
35,is cpsc 110 or 121 harder,3
36,literally listening to sad music and staring blankly into space rn,1
37,The grade is out! Hope yâ€™all are doing good in this midterm.,5

59,"""Binary division is too difficult to make you do for a midterm but fuck it do it anyway""",2
60,"At least I understood how to do the last question...
That robot question is not something you would expect on a 75 minute midterm. :(",2
61,"To make you all feel better, it gets worse (:",3

64,Why do I feel this meme get reposted every year,1
65,It wasnâ€™t that bad compared to the assignments,3
66,The assignments of CPSC 121 were really tough. I probably spent an avg of 24 hours on each assignment. I am kinda dumb though.,3
67,"I feel you assignment 1 is killing me so far. 1 3 and 5 took me around 15 hours of work after I gave up on 2, and 4 looks impossible.",1
68,Predicate logic chose not to exist today. Instead we got offset binary (worded terribly) and multiplexers. My ass is sore...,1
