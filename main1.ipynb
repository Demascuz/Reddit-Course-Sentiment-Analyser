      "Seems like this is the most complained about class by far\n",
      "I wish someone was sucking the soul outta me üò©\n",
      "It gets better. Most other courses are much more interesting than 121.\n",
      "That‚Äôs interesting‚Ä¶ I found 121 very interesting but 110 not lol. It gets better later on in third and fourth years since you have more freedom to choose what to take. If you like 110 you‚Äôll prob like 210 and 310 as well\n",
      "You‚Äôll end up using everything you‚Äôre learning in 121 in later courses so it‚Äôs important to really understand the material and not just get it done. \n",
      "\n",
      "While it‚Äôs not necessary that you enjoy getting piped by 121, I think it‚Äôs important you find the material by itself interesting if you want to major in computer science. It‚Äôs really the foundation of the science of computer science.\n",
      "I‚Äôm taking 121 this sem too!\n",
      "For me personally the content is starting to get more interesting with arguments and stuff (except DFAs), but I *literally* can‚Äôt be bothered with circuit stuff lol. So I dread every lab haha (not anyone‚Äôs fault, just my personal interests) maybe you‚Äôll stumble upon a module you‚Äôll like, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also find the assignments not too enjoyable, maybe because I had to almost solo assignment 1 when my teammates were afk, but I do enjoy the wkshts, tutorials, and exercise sets from the textbook. I think it's because there's no academic pressure with those, so if you have time and haven't done so already, try doing some textbook exercises or tutorials and wkshts on your own time :) that way you focus on the learning and not the grade\n",
      "\n",
      "At least you did ok on the MT haha, I scored pretty bad on the midterm even though I did all wkshts, tutorials, redid hard questions I had trouble with, exercise sets, few past MTs and as mentioned tackled all assignment 1 questions :‚Äô)\n",
      "so idk what else I need to do in regards to my studying tbh :/\n",
      "Hang in there bud.\n",
      "I hated 121 and didn‚Äôt do that well in it relative to other CS classes. Every 2nd and 3rd year cs class I‚Äôve done since has been far less painful\n",

      "Congrats i hate it too, completely useless imo\n",

      "Or if you're willing to stoop to the level, Sauder. Sauder's literally about money.\n",
      "Now that‚Äôs some bullshit. Respectfully speaking, it‚Äôll probably be better to learn proofs which is the only thing remotely useful through that one math course.\n",
      "Eh the money is nothing crazy unless your in banking, but then you have no life. Maybe some high paying roles in mid to late career but nothing right out of school like SWE in the US.\n",
      "95% of Sauder grads make nowhere near CS\n",
      "The average for that course is much worse. You'd be surprised how much people prefer 121 over math 220\n",

      "Also, in which cities do they work ?\n",
      "That is true. To me, i barely learned anything useful other than logic and proofing from 121. Those two are the only thing i remember being used in upper cs courses. That being the case, I‚Äôd rather have that math class where proofing is taught extensively. I‚Äôd rather have a full course that teaches something that i know will be used rather than 121 where 50-75% is never used again. Its like paying for a full 3 credits coure but only 25% of your tuition money is paying off. Heck i have never even used proofs now in the industry. Sorry its basically just me ranting how different academia and industry now. \n",

      "Agree with you on the industry side, but keep in mind that this is an academic program where many students go on to academia and industry research, both of which require proofs and logic. Just because the course wasn't useful for you, it doesn't mean its not useful for everyone.\n",
